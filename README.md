A small tool with the mere purpose of starting/stopping music in Spotify when you plug your headphones in.
Depending on whether Spotify is already started or not, this is delayed by a few seconds as to let it load.

Connects automatically to bluetooth devices and starts to play audio.

Tested on a HTC Sensation with Android 4.3 and a HTC Car A200.
